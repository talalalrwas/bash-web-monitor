# Bash web monitor
***
A script that utilizes `curl` and `md5sum` to monitor websites for changes.

## Features
 - for now it only checks for change and prints out the results accordingly

## TODO
 - [ ] use cron for scheduling
 - [ ] notify for results
 - [ ] make it work with IFTTT and discord webhooks
